# Usage

## Run

```bash
just run
```
## Configuration

Configuration uses a single **`config.lua`** file at the project root. It returns a named table of experiments — every entry is a fully-specified run. The runtime injects C++ struct defaults as the `moonai_defaults` global (2000 agents on a 3000×3000 square world), so Lua only needs to override what it changes.

### `config.lua`

```lua
-- moonai_defaults is injected by the runtime (mirrors C++ SimulationConfig defaults)
-- Defaults: 500 predators, 1500 prey (2000 total), 3000×3000 square world, 1500 steps per report window
local function extend(t, overrides) ... end

-- Helper: scale world and food proportionally to population
local function scale_base(pred, prey)
    local total = pred + prey
    local default_total = moonai_defaults.predator_count + moonai_defaults.prey_count
    local factor = math.sqrt(total / default_total)
    return {
        predator_count = pred, prey_count = prey,
        grid_size = math.floor(moonai_defaults.grid_size * factor),
        food_count = math.floor(moonai_defaults.food_count * (total / default_total)),
    }
end

local conditions = {
    baseline = moonai_defaults,
    scale_5k = extend(moonai_defaults, scale_base(1250, 3750)),
    -- ...
}
local seeds = { 42, 43, 44, 45, 46 }

local experiments = {}
for name, cfg in pairs(conditions) do
    for _, seed in ipairs(seeds) do
        experiments[name .. "_seed" .. seed] = extend(cfg, { seed = seed, max_generations = 200 })
    end
end

experiments["default"] = moonai_defaults  -- auto-selected by 'just run'
return experiments
```

A single-entry file auto-selects without `--experiment`. The `default` entry serves as the everyday run config.

Set `seed` to `0` for random seed, or a fixed value for reproducible experiments in `config.lua`.

## Running Simulation

### Examples

```bash
just run                                              # GUI with default config
just run -- --headless                                # Headless mode
just run -- --experiment mut_low_seed42 --headless    # One experiment
just run-release -- --all --headless                  # Full batch (release build)
```

### List available experiments

Shows all experiments in config.lua.

```bash
just list-experiments       
```

### Run experiments

275 seeded runs + default entry → output/

```bash
just experiment-run
```

### Set up Python and generate analysis

Installs simulation + profiler analysis dependencies via uv.

```bash
just setup-python
```

Reads output/, writes a self-contained HTML report.

```bash
just experiment-analyse
```

### Full pipeline

Runs all experiments + generates report.

```bash
just experiment
```

## Simulation Output

Each run writes to `output/{experiment_name}/` (named experiments) or `output/YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_seedN/` (anonymous runs):

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `config.json` | Full config snapshot for this run |
| `stats.csv` | One row per report interval sample with current state plus cumulative event totals: `step, predator_count, prey_count, predator_births, prey_births, predator_deaths, prey_deaths, predator_species, prey_species, avg_predator_complexity, avg_prey_complexity, avg_predator_energy, avg_prey_energy, max_predator_generation, avg_predator_generation, max_prey_generation, avg_prey_generation` |
| `species.csv` | One row per species per generation: `step, population, species_id, size, avg_complexity` |
| `genomes.json` | Representative genome snapshots (nodes + connections JSON) |

## Analysis

The Python analysis tool generates self-contained HTML report for all qualifying runs in `output/`.

```bash
just experiment-analyse
```

Internally this runs the packaged analysis entry point from `analysis/`:

```bash
cd analysis && uv run moonai-analysis
```

The analysis writes a timestamped report to `analysis/output/`, for example `report_20260324_154233.html`.

The generated HTML is fully self-contained: it embeds all plots and report data directly into a single file, including:

- per-condition plots for population, species, complexity, and representative-genome topology
- cross-condition comparison plots using seed-aggregated statistics
- the grouped summary table at the final sampled generation
- skipped-run information for incomplete or invalid runs
- inline styling and navigation so the report opens directly in a browser without side files

The analysis code is structured as a small package under `analysis/moonai_analysis/`:

- `pipeline.py` orchestrates the full analysis run
- `io.py` discovers runs and loads CSV/JSON data
- `labels.py` groups runs into experiment conditions
- `plots.py` generates embedded per-condition and comparison figures
- `genome.py` renders embedded representative-genome topology diagrams
- `summary.py` prepares structured summary data for the report
- `html_report.py` renders the final self-contained HTML document
- `templates/report.html` defines the HTML report layout

## Experiment conditions

55 conditions defined in `config.lua` across 9 groups, each × 5 seeds = **275 seeded runs**, plus the unseeded `default` entry.

The default baseline is 2000 agents (500 predators, 1500 prey) on a 3000×3000 square world with 1500 steps per report window. Scaled experiments use `scale_base()` to maintain agent density by proportionally adjusting world size and food count.

- Group A — Baseline sweeps (2K agents)
- Group B — Scale experiments (proportional world)
- Group C — Parameter sweeps at 5K
- Group D — Parameter sweeps at 10K
- Group E — World density (5K agents, varying world size)
- Group F — Reporting window length
- Group G — Energy / resource dynamics
- Group H — Agent speed / interaction range (5K)
- Group I — Topology complexity

## Large-scale experiments

Experiments with 5K+ agents require significant compute. Recommendations:

- **Release build** (`just release`) for 2-5x faster simulation
- **Headless mode** (`--headless`) disables gui for maximum throughput
- **Memory**: ~4 GB RAM for 10K agents, ~8 GB for 20K agents
- **VRAM**: ~512 MB for 10K agents, ~1 GB for 20K agents
- Running all 330 experiments sequentially takes significant time; use `--experiment` to run specific conditions or parallelize across machines

## Profiler

The profiler executable is available but not built by default (set `MOONAI_BUILD_PROFILER=ON` to enable). It captures detailed per-frame timing data for performance analysis.

### Running the Profiler

```bash
just profile-run                                     # Run with defaults (300 frames, 6 seeds)
just profile-run --frames 300                        # Custom frame count
just profile-run --name mytest --output-dir results  # Custom name and output
```

**CLI Arguments:**

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--frames N` | 300 | Number of frames to capture per run |
| `--name <name>` | profile | Experiment name (used in output filename) |
| `--output-dir <path>` | output/profiles | Output directory |

Each profiler run writes a single JSON file to `output/profiles/`:

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_name.json` | Suite manifest with per-frame timing data from all seeds |

The profiler drops the fastest and slowest runs by average frame time, and reports aggregate timing data from the remaining runs. Standard simulation builds do not include profiler instrumentation.

### Generating Reports

```bash
just profile-analyse    # Generate HTML report from latest profile run
just profile            # Full pipeline: run profiler and build report
```

The profiler writes a timestamped self-contained HTML report to `profiler/output/`, for example `profile_report_20260324_154233.html`.

The profiler package lives under `profiler/moonai_profiler/` and includes:

- `pipeline.py` for orchestration
- `io.py` for discovering and validating profile runs
- `plots.py` for embedded timing charts
- `html_report.py` for rendering
- `templates/report.html` for layout

## Visualization Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Space` | Pause / resume |
| `↑` / `↓` or `+` / `-` | Increase / decrease simulation speed |
| `.` | Step one step (while paused) |
| `S` | Save screenshot |
| `Esc` | Quit |
| Left-click | Select an agent (shows stats + live NN panel) |
| Right-click drag | Pan camera |
| Scroll wheel | Zoom |

When an agent is selected, its **vision range** (semi-transparent circle), **sensor lines** (connections to nearby agents and food), and **stats panel** are automatically displayed. The agent controller receives 35 inputs: the 5 closest predators, prey, and food items as signed proximity-weighted `dx, dy` pairs, plus self energy, velocity `x/y`, and signed wall proximity on `x/y`. Missing targets are encoded as `0`, and closer objects produce larger absolute values in `[-1, 1]`. The **Network panel** shows its neural network topology with edges colored by weight value: blue (positive) → gray (near zero) → orange (negative).
