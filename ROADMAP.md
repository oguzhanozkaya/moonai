# MoonAI - Implementation Roadmap

A step-by-step guide to fully implementing MoonAI. Each phase builds on the previous one. Phases are designed to produce a testable, working system at each stage.

> **Status as of 2026-03-17:** Phases 1–7 complete or nearly complete. Phase 5 (GPU) fully implemented: CSR-packed kernels, RAII device memory, runtime CPU fallback. Phase 8 (Experimentation) is the current focus.

## Phase 2: Simulation Environment ✅ Complete

**Goal:** Agents move around in a 2D world with collision detection and sensing.

### 2.1 Environment

- [x] Implement Prey-specific behavior: energy gain from resources, fleeing mechanics
- [x] Add death conditions: stamina depletion, being caught by predator
- [x] Add age tracking for fitness calculation

### 2.3 Physics and Sensing

---

## Phase 3: NEAT Evolution Core ✅ Mostly Complete

**Goal:** Full NEAT algorithm implementation. Agents evolve neural networks that control their behavior.

### 3.1 Genome Encoding
- [x] Finalize node gene structure (id, type, activation function)
- [x] Finalize connection gene structure (in, out, weight, enabled, innovation)
- [x] Implement global innovation number tracking with historical markings
  - Use a lookup table: (in_node, out_node) -> innovation number
  - This prevents duplicate innovations from getting different numbers
- [x] Implement genome serialization to/from JSON for checkpointing
- [x] Write comprehensive tests for genome operations

### 3.2 Neural Network (Phenotype)

- [x] Write tests: verify output for known network topologies with hand-calculated values
- [x] Benchmark: measure forward pass time for 1000 networks *(debug timing via `--verbose`, `just bench-nn`)*

### 3.3 Mutation Operators
- [x] **Weight mutation**: perturb existing weight (90%) vs. replace with random (10%)
- [x] **Add connection**: connect two previously unconnected nodes
- [x] **Add node**: split an existing connection with a new hidden node
- [x] **Toggle connection**: enable/disable a connection
- [ ] **Delete connection** (optional): remove a connection entirely
- [x] Ensure all mutations maintain valid network structure (no dangling nodes)
- [x] Write tests: mutated genomes produce valid networks that can be evaluated

### 3.4 Crossover
- [x] Implement multipoint crossover following the NEAT paper:
  - Matching genes: randomly pick from either parent
  - Disjoint/excess genes: take from fitter parent
- [x] Handle disabled genes: if disabled in either parent, 75% chance of being disabled in child
- [x] Write tests: crossover produces valid genomes, fitness-based parent preference works

### 3.5 Speciation
- [x] Implement compatibility distance (c1 * excess + c2 * disjoint + c3 * avg_weight_diff)
- [x] Implement species assignment: each genome goes to the first compatible species
- [x] Update species representative each generation (random member or best member)
- [x] Implement dynamic compatibility threshold adjustment to maintain target species count
- [x] Remove stagnant species (no fitness improvement for N generations)
- [x] Write tests: genomes are correctly grouped, stagnant species are culled

### 3.6 Selection and Reproduction
- [x] Implement explicit fitness sharing (divide fitness by species size)
- [x] Calculate offspring allocation per species (proportional to adjusted fitness sum) *(largest-remainder method)*
- [x] Implement elitism: preserve champion of each species unchanged
- [x] Implement tournament selection within species for parent selection
- [x] Fill population with crossover (configured rate) + mutation
- [x] Maintain constant population size across generations
- [x] Write tests: population size is maintained, elitism preserves best genomes

### 3.7 Fitness Function
- [x] Design predator fitness: weighted sum of kills, survival, energy efficiency
- [x] Design prey fitness: weighted sum of survival, food eaten, energy efficiency
- [x] Distance-traveled component: `fitness_distance_weight` now tracked in `Agent.distance_traveled_` and used in `compute_fitness()`
- [x] Make fitness weights configurable in JSON
- [x] Complexity penalty: small per-connection/node deduction discourages bloat

### 3.8 Integration: Wire NEAT to Simulation
- [x] Assign one genome per agent at generation start
- [x] Build neural network from genome, use it for agent decision-making each tick
- [x] After generation ends, collect fitness from agents, assign to genomes
- [x] Run evolution (speciation, selection, reproduction, mutation)
- [x] Spawn new agents with new genomes for next generation
- [x] End-to-end test: run 10 generations, verify fitness improves (or at least doesn't crash)

**Deliverable:** Complete NEAT loop running. Agents controlled by evolving neural networks. Fitness improves over generations.

## Development Principles

1. **Test as you go** - Write tests for each component before moving to the next phase
2. **CPU first, GPU second** - Get everything working on CPU, then accelerate with CUDA
3. **Small commits** - Each completed task gets its own commit on the dev branch
4. **Branch per feature** - Use feature branches off `dev`, merge via PR with code review
5. **Reproduce everything** - Every result must be reproducible with a seed + config
